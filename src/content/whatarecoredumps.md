## What are core dumps?

Simply put core dumps are a snapshot of the state of a process.

Core dumps are one of the oldest forms of debugging. The name originates from a time when [magnetic cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory) were the main implementation of Random Access Memory(RAM) and dumps were printed out onto paper.

Today core dumps are generated by travesing the memory of a process and outputting it to an [Executable Linkable Format(ELF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) so that it can be interogated further.

The layout of an core dump is defined as follows

- *ELF Header* provides type and architecture information
- *Program header table* defines the process layout for the system to prepare execution
- *.text* is the definition of the program
- *.rodata* is the read-only data for the program
- *.data* stores the variables initialized by the user 
- *Section header table* presents extra information about the sections in the program

A much more detailed text description is available [in this pdf](/pdfs/ELF_Format.pdf).

There is a lot going in this picture but if you are working with ELF files and need a desk reminder
This is a great tool by Ange_Albertini.
